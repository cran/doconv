Description: Functions to convert 'Microsoft Word' or 'Microsoft PowerPoint' 
 documents to 'PDF' format and also for converting them into a thumbnail. 
 In order to work, 'LibreOffice' must be installed on the machine and 
 or 'Microsoft Word'. If the latter is available, 
 it can be used to produce PDF documents identical to the originals, 
 otherwise, 'LibreOffice' is used. A function is also provided to update 
 all fields and table of contents of a Word document using 'Microsoft Word'.
